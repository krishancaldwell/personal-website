## Hello!

This whole project is entirely just so I can play with React + Redux. It's a very simple website so these tools are completely unnecessary but fun.

It is created on the back of create-react-app, so comes loaded with various convenience methods.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
